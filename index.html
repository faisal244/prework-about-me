      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>West Bromwich, West Midlands</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like listening to music too loud, obsessing over tv shows, being outdoors, band t-shirts, M&M’s, cat memes, sleeping, travelling, music, festivals, film analysis, the Simpsons, cinema, more Netflix than I care to admit, going to all the gigs, touring unique restaurants and curry houses, horror movies, collecting records, dj’ing hard fast noises, audiobooks and podcasts, stand up comedy, globetrotting, meeting new people and generally instigating vibes everywhere I go.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Full Stack Software Developer for an organisation that is on the bleeding edge of innovation</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Smethwick, West Midlands</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always regretted not studying Computer Science at university. For most of my career as a digital marketing professional, I have been fortunate enough to work with some extremely talented developers, but I’ve always wished that i was on the other side of the table - the the one doing the development and hands on implementation instead of just facilitating it. 

        And with the pandemic taking its toll over the last 18 months, it has caused me to reconsider my goals and priorities in life, and i have come to realise that it is never too late to pivot and change direction in terms of careers. I’ve realised that i want to work for organisations and on projects that solve problems and try to make the world a better place by leveraging the latest technologies - and learning to code would give me the skill set to make this dream a reality.</p>
